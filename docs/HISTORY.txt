Changelog
=========

0.5.1 (2012-04-15)
------------------

- Errors and error views are now correctly located. Already located errors
  are not subject to any change. They simply need to provide `Ilocation` to
  avoid unwanted relocation.


0.5 (2012-01-30)
----------------

- ``cromlech.dawnlight`` now provides a custom `ViewLookup` components that
  is more flexible : trying to publish a view directly now works without the
  need of an extra "default view".


0.4.1 (2012-01-27)
------------------

- Unicode paths were failing due to the transformation of the request path,
  through `unquote` and then the transformation to unicode. This has been
  fixed and tested.


0.4 (2012-01-24)
----------------

- Error handling is now implemented as a decorator for the `publish` method.
  This allows more flexibility in the catching and rendering of errors.
  A base adapter is provided, adapting an exception to `IHTTPResponse`,
  using the query of an `IHTTPRenderer`.

  The adapter from `IHTTPRenderer` to `IHTTPResponse` has been modified
  accordingly and heavily commented as it was judged a bit cryptic by
  the newcomers. 


0.3b4 (2012-01-11)
------------------

- The lookup wrappers have now been modified to only be used on the lookup
  function passed to the `ViewLookup` component.


0.3b3 (2012-01-11)
------------------

- We no longer inherit from `ViewLookup` to provide a base lookup method.
  This method can be simply passed to the constructor. 2 decorator-like
  functions have been added in `utils` allowing to wrap a basic lookup
  function to provide locatisation and/or protection.

  The protection wrapper is only available if the `zope.security` package
  is present as it uses the `ProxyFactory` mechanism.

- Adapted the code and tests to the latest interfaces split made in
  `cromlech.io` and `cromlech.browser`.


0.3b2 (2011-11-23)
------------------

- Now only attributes declared thanks to `traversable` directive are
  traversable ! This help keeping things under control.

  Note that it does not work like in `Grok` : it is a ONCE directive
  either you inherit it or you re-declare all attributes.


0.3b1 (2011-11-04)
------------------

- url unquote path to unicode before traversing so content under
  a unicode key in a container is reached by traverser


0.3a3 (2011-09-07)
------------------

- better re-raise of errors in publisher


0.3a2 (2011-09-07)
------------------

- The error rendering now strips the original failing view of all its
  proxies, to avoid security proxies and other blocking proxies that can
  shadow the true result.


0.3a1 (2011-09-03)
------------------

- Enhanced the IHTTPRenderer to IResult adapter to provide a comprehensive
  error handling. We can now bubble error in case of ComponentLookupErrors
  and we can provide renderers for other errors.


0.2b1 (2011-08-27)
------------------

- Fixed and refined the publish method of the publisher.


0.2a4 (2011-08-25)
------------------

- Cleaned up the IHTTPRenderer resolution to an IResult.
- Added tests for all kind of errors during the publication.


0.2a3 (2011-08-25)
------------------

- refactored publication process
- ComponentLookupError in views are not hidden anymore


0.2a2 (2011-07-04)
------------------

- Added a separated ZCML files to "grok" `the IConsumer` components.


0.2a1 (2011-07-02)
------------------

- Using now dawnlight >= 0.13b2. The code has been modified accordingly.
- Splitted the code into logical modules.


0.1a3 (2011-06-14)
------------------

Using dawlight >= 0.12b1 that remove bug with ending slash in path


0.1a2 (2011-05-16)
------------------

- Made the lookups pluggable.
- `DawnlightPublisher` is no longer a `MultiAdapter`. Now, it uses an adapter
  factory.


0.1a1 (2011-05-09)
------------------

Initial release
